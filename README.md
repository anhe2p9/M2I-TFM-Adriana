# ILP Model Engine

This project provides a command-line engine for solving ILP (Integer Linear Programming) problems related to reducing cognitive complexity in Java code refactorings at the method level. The tool supports solving both single-objective and multi-objective ILP instances using various algorithms and configurations.


## üì¶ Requirements
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/es-es/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio)

The library has been tested in Linux (Mint and Ubuntu) and Windows 11.


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download and Installation
1. Install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
2. Download/Clone this repository and enter into the main directory.
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the environment: 
   
   In Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

   In Windows: `.\env\Scripts\Activate`

   ** In case that you are running Ubuntu, please install the package python3-dev with the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-dev` and update wheel and setuptools with the command `pip  install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools` right after step 4.
   
5. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`



## üí° Overview

The main purpose of this application is to automate the generation and resolution of ILP models designed to **optimize code refactorings**. The models aim to **minimize**:

1. The number of extractions (refactorings).
2. The difference between the maximum and minimum **cognitive complexity** across all resulting sequences.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum **lines of code** across all resulting sequences.

## üß† Problem Context

Given a Java method and its corresponding **refactoring cache**, the system builds ILP model instances to explore different refactoring strategies. These models are then solved with one of several available algorithms.

The results may vary:
- A **.csv file** and a corresponding **.lp file** for **single-objective** ILP.
- For **multi-objective** problems (2 or 3 objectives), a set of solutions using:
  - **Weighted sum** (single or multiple combinations).
  - **Augmented Œµ-constraint** (for two objectives).
  - A **hybrid algorithm** (for three objectives), exploring the entire objective space to generate an approximate Pareto front.

## üß™ Output Types

Depending on the model and input configuration, the application can generate:

- For **single-objective ILP**:
  - A `.csv` file containing the solution.
  - An `.lp` file representing the ILP model for each instance.

- For **multi-objective ILP** (2 or 3 objectives):
  - A set of non-dominated solutions (Pareto front), either:
    - via **weighted sum**:
      - using a sweep over weight combinations (`--subdivisions`), or
      - with a specific combination (`--weights`).
    - via **augmented Œµ-constraint** algorithm (`--algorithm`), for 2 objectives.
      - CSV file with results.
      - Concrete model.
      - Output data with the solution for each Java method.
    - via a **hybrid objective-space exploration algorithm**, for 3 objectives:
      - CSV file with results.
      - Concrete model.
      - Output data with the solution for each Java method.
      - Nadir point.
      - Plot in case of requested.

## üß† Objectives (Cognitive Complexity Metrics)

The optimization process focuses on refactoring Java methods by minimizing the following cognitive complexity metrics:

1. **Number of Extractions**:  
   The total number of code extractions performed.  
   _Goal_: Minimize to keep changes limited.

2. **Complexity Range**:  
   Difference between the highest and lowest cognitive complexity values among extracted sequences.  
   _Goal_: Minimize to ensure balanced complexity across parts.

3. **Lines of Code Range**:  
   Difference between the largest and smallest number of lines of code among extracted parts.  
   _Goal_: Minimize to obtain balanced code lengths.

## üóÇÔ∏è Additional Script

A secondary `input_files_main.py` located in **ILP_data_from_refactoring_cache** folder is used to **generate ILP input files** from a refactoring cache. This cache must be generated beforehand by another tool that analyzes Java code.

The arguments for this file is the `input_folder` and `output_folder`.

---

## üìò Examples

This command generates the input needed for the main module of the tool:
```bash
python input_files_main.py ./input_folder ./output_folder
```


This command generates the solution for two-objectives ILP problem with weighted sum algorithm for two objectives:
```bash
python main.py -m multiobjective -i ./instances/my_instance -a WeightedSumAlgorithm2obj -t 2 -s 6 -o seq,cc
```


This command generates the solution for three-objectives ILP problem with hybrid method algorithm for three objectives, and it also generates the parallel coordinates plot and the complete Pareto front in three dimensions:
```bash
python main.py -m multiobjective -i ./instances/my_instance -a HybirdMethodForThreeObj -t 15 -o seq,cc,loc --plot --3dPF
```
